The code demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis process, from data cleaning and exploration to visualization and modeling:
1. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    -Generating summary statistics for specific columns (dplyr::select, group_by, summarize).
    -Creating bar charts and visualizations to explore relationships between variables (ggplot2).
2. ### Correlation Analysis:
    -Computing the correlation matrix between numeric variables (cor).
    -Visualizing the correlation matrix using a heatmap (ggcorrplot).
3. ### Linear Regression:
    -Building linear regression models (lm) to analyze relationships between variables.
    -Evaluating model performance and extracting coefficients, R-squared, and AIC values.
