### Chi-Square_ANOVA.R
In the provided R code, the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test assesses the difference between observed and expected categorical data, examining blood types, airline performance, ethnicity, military roles, baseball wins, and crop yields. ANOVA tests compare means across multiple groups, analyzing sodium content, food sales, education expenditures, and plant growth under different conditions.

### Fish_Dataset.R
In the R code, linear regression is employed to explore relationships between fish characteristics. Three separate regression analyses are conducted, examining the influence of fish weight on vertical length, height, and diagonal width. Each regression model is visualized through scatter plots, and their details are summarized, providing insights into the associations between the variables.

### BostonHousingDataset.R
The R script performs a comprehensive analysis of a Boston housing dataset, exploring factors such as building costs, land costs, and taxes across decades. It includes data cleaning, summary statistics, visualization with bar charts and scatter plots, linear regression modeling, and correlation matrices. The script produces insightful visualizations and statistical insights for effective data interpretation.

### HypothesisTesting.R & HypothesisTesting2.R
The R code conducts hypothesis testing on educational and sleep quality data. For student performance, it assesses gender-based score differences, rejecting null hypotheses for math and writing scores. In sleep quality, the code compares scores before and after meditation, rejecting the null hypothesis of equal means, indicating a potential impact on sleep quality.

### NetFlix_Movies_Dataset.R
The R script analyzes a Netflix movies dataset, cleaning and processing information such as ratings, genres, and actors. It transforms data, removes invalid characters, and generates visualizations, including a pie chart of genres, a bar plot of top actors, and a scatterplot of highest-rated movies over the years, providing valuable insights.

### LASSO_Ridge.R
The provided R script employs Ridge and Lasso regularization on a College dataset. It splits the data, performs Ridge regression with cross-validation, visualizes results, fits models, analyzes coefficients, and calculates Root Mean Square Errors. The process showcases the impact of regularization in improving model performance and feature selection.
